    <h1>Financial Information</h1>

    <h2>What is Finance?</h2>
    <p>
        Finance is the study and discipline of money, currency, and capital aspects.
        It also involves the management of money and includes activities such as
        investing, borrowing, lending, saving, and budgeting.
    </p>

    <h2>Why is Finance Required?</h2>
    <p>
        Finance is vital in any economic system as it allows individuals and
        companies to purchase products and services beyond their immediate
        financial reach. Financing helps leverage the time value of money by
        putting future expected income to use for current projects.
    </p>

    <h2>What are Investments?</h2>
    <p>
        An investment is an asset or item purchased with the expectation that
        it will generate income or appreciate in value in the future.
    </p>
